# Getting Started

## Run Test with this command
```bash
$ flutter driver --target=test_driver/app.dart
<<<<<<< HEAD
```

## Test Directory

### This file is entrypoint for integration testing
```javascript 
test_driver/app.dart
```

### this file is test file
```javascript
test_driver/app_test.dart
```

## SLDC
1. Create folder based on screen. Add file to store element and function on that screen
2. Create folder based on scenarios. Add *_test.dart on this file as a scenario execution
3. if we wants to works closely with eng, we can separate root folder becomes two folders (unit & integration). Also will include no 1 and 2.

## Next Development
1. Flutter Gherkin
2. Reports
3. Page Objects
4. CI / CD implementations
